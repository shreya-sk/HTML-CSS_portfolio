  <h1>Shreya's Portfolio</h1>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> Hello! My  name is Shreya Kothari, and I am from Jaipur, a small city in Rajasthan, India. I did my high-school from Neerja Modi School, and attanined my International Baccalureate (IB) diploma in 2020. I am looking to attend college this fall, and am hoping to pursue Computer-science as my major. I am a person of varied interests, and am open to indulging in and exploring different fields of interests as I find things that connect smoothly for me.</p>
  <p> One of my current interests include coding, and since this is my first time independently writing a code, I am very excited to see it come live! This portfolio was made using HTML and CSS. While I am still new and excited in the field of coding, few of my absolute favorite go-to activities remain painting, scrap-booking, bullet journaling, running and ofcourse book-reading. </p>
  <p> If there's anything you'd like me to know, please contact me via the information below!</p>
